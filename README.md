# Drowsy Driver Detection System
>This project implements a real-time blink detection and drowsiness alert system using Python, OpenCV, dlib, and other libraries.
>
This code is designed to detect blinks and alert for drowsiness by analyzing a person's eye behavior through a webcam feed. It utilizes facial landmarks detection and eye aspect ratio (EAR) to determine if a person's eyes are closed or open. When drowsiness is detected, an alert is triggered with an alarm sound.
